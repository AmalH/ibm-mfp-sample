  "description": "Mahdia is small city which keeps its original traditions, where the women cover themselves with gold jewelry and the houses are decorated with embroidered hangings. Its monumental gateway calls back to its glorious past: it was the first capital of the great Fatimid dynasty, who would go on to reign in Egypt and Syria. Its medina stretches out along a narrow peninsula, surrounded by deep blue waters; its sumptuous beaches delight the tourists. A charming city with many faces."
